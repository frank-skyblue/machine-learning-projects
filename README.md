# machine-learning-projects

This repository contains all of the machine learning projects I've done.

I've had built small projects in machine learning topics such as
- [Admissions prediction](Regressions/Linear/K_means_LR.ipynb) using **Linear Regression**
- [Image Inpainting](Regressions/RBF/rbf_regression.py) using **Radial Basis Function Regression**
- [News Classifier](Classification/part2.ipynb) using **Gaussian, kNN, and Naive Bayes Classifiers**
- [Sentiment Analysis (Audio)](SVM-PCA/A3_StarterCode.ipynb) using **Support Vector Machine and Principal Component Analysis (For data size reduction)**
