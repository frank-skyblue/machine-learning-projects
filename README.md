# machine-learning-projects

This repository contains all of the machine learning projects I've done.

I've had practice in machine learning topics such as
- [linear regression](Regressions/Linear/K_means_LR.ipynb)
- [RBF regression](Regressions/RBF/rbf_regression.py)
- [classification](Classification/part2.ipynb) (Gaussian, kNN, Naive Bayes)
- [SVM/PCA](SVM-PCA/A3_StarterCode.ipynb)
